    <p>
      A community driven speaking event based on the format of 20 slides auto-advancing every 15 seconds. Wichitalks was founded on January 1st, 2016 after reading <a href="http://www.startuprev.com/category/communities/" target="_blank">Startup Communities</a> by Brad Feld, and in response to the desire to connect many of the vibrant and passionate subcommunities within Wichita.<br><br>

    <h3>Cristin Hancox Photography</h3>
    <p>
      A Jekyll website built for Cristin Hancox to support her photography. I utilized the <a href="http://arkadianriver.github.io/spectral/" target="_blank">Spectral Theme</a> to help build the site.<br><br>

    <h3>Pacerr</h3>
    <p>
      An iOS app built in Swift to help pace a run by generating a virtual pacer and providing feedback as to your position relative to the virtual pacer. Since it was made, new versions of Swift have been released and broken the code in this app. I intend to remake this app using <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/">Cordova</a> so that it is easier to maintain and can be deployed to different mobile platforms.<br><br>
