            <p>Hey, I'm Kevin. (The one all the way to the right)</p>
            <p>I run things like <a href="https://github.com/dev-osan">{dev}Osan</a> and enjoy solving problems with <a href="/portfolio">code</a>. Other than that, I love running, playing guitar, and eating at some of my favorite restaurants while living in South Korea. 안녕하세요! I spend most of my time working for the United States Air Force.</p>
            <p>After 7 years of honorable military service, I'm ready to transfer the teamwork, communication, discipline, and work ethic I've gained to the Software Engineering field. Having spent many nights and weekends building software solutions for the US Air Force, I have developed a number of projects using Node, Angular, TypeScript, and Python, including technologies such as Heroku, git, Raspberry Pi, PostgreSQL, and Arduino, leaving me more than ready to join a fast-moving team.</p>
            <p>I'm seeking a full-time remote position or a position in Manchester, UK where I intend to live for the next year. A company that holds integrity and excellence as it's core values, expects it's team to always be learning and pushing themselves, and most importantly is interested in delivering value to not only it's clients, but it's employees as well, will make a great fit.</p>
            <p>Thank you, and I look forward to joining your team.</p>
            <p>Stay Cool<br>- Kevin</p>
