  <p>Hey,</p>
  <p><span class="indent"></span>I'm Kevin and I'm learning about web development right now. This is a personal site that I've built for a final project in one of my classes. I wrote a post about the project titled "Final Project Description." Check it out if you want to know more. For now, this site is a static website with no server side business logic. What I mean is that this website isn't dynamically served depending on who's accessing it. Everyone sees the same site.</p>
  <p><span class="indent"></span>Anyways, I hope you enjoy looking around. It was fun building this site. Hopefully it gets me a good grade.</p>
