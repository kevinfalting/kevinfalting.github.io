		I am an active duty Airman stationed at McConnell AFB in Wichita, KS. I am passionate about business and software, currently making every effort I can to build the skills I need to excel. I founded <a href="http://wichitalks.com" target="_blank">Wichitalks</a>, a community driven speaking event that brings together the amazing people of Wichita to collide passions. I participate as much as possible with <a href="http://startupwichita.com/">Startup Wichita</a>, do as much running as I can, and occasionally break away for a sail on one of the lakes nearby.
