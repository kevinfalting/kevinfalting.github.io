I've finally converted my site over to github pages from squarespace! I was paying some stupid amount of money to keep it there and now I can completely customize my site. I've built it using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} and hosted it using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"} with absolutely no cost. This was an awesome learning experience and will continue to be as I get better. However, I'm sure that my website here will remain pretty simple.

I've never had a website that I could post whatever I like on, so here goes!

```bash
$ git commit -m "init commit"
```
