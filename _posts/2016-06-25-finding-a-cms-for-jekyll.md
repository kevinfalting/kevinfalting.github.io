In my search for a CMS, I've found two candidates, and the way I'll evaluate them is by starting this article in one, and then finishing it in the other, ultimately figuring out which one I will go with.

I am doing everything in my power to stay away from one of the major content management systems like Wordpress or Drupal and so on, and find one that will meet the needs of the client and allow me to configure it in a way that will align with the way they intend to operate. I have a few things that I'm looking for, anything extra is a bonus.

1. A "Content Management System" should only do that, manage content. I don't want it to manage any functionality, design, or services. I need a CMS that will allow the client to update or add copy, images, or new pages, and nothing else.
2. It should commit to the repo I have set up.
3. I should be able to configure what the client can and can not do.
4. I need to be able to give the client a login to their site and they access/update the site at anytime.
5. I should be able to manage multiple sites from one account.
6. Clients should be able to understand and use the system with minimal training.
7. The client must be able to edit the page copy easily.

The two CMS's that I'm considering are [Forestry.io](http://forestry.io) and [Cloudcannon](http://cloudcannon.com/). Both appear to be great options at first glance, so let's dive in.

I'm performing the first analysis of forestry.io, and at first glance the interface and ease of use is very simple. I must point out that this site is currently under development, and I have beta access to the site. I'm super stoked for this, and I hope these guys are able to build this into all it could be.

Forestry links up with a few different repos or you can upload a zip file of the site. The site that I chose to use is hosted on Github Pages and is my personal site.

When I've logged in, there is a folder for each of the pages and posts. There is also a place for "chunks" which are Jekyll data files. The text editor I'm writing this in has the standard styling buttons.

I've inserted a picture and it appears that it will save the image on Forestry and embedd a link to the picture I uploaded, so the picture is not being hosted with the site.
