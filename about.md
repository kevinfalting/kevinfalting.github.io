I am an active duty Airman stationed at McConnell AFB in Wichita, KS. I am passionate about business and software, currently making every effort I can to build the skills I need to excel. I founded [Wichitalks](http://wichitalks.com/){:target="_blank"}, a community driven speaking event that brings together the amazing people of Wichita to collide passions. I participate as much as possible with [Startup Wichita](http://startupwichita.com/){:target="_blank"}, do as much running as I can, and occasionally break away for a sail on one of the lakes nearby.  

I'm always up for trying a new beer if you'd like to meetup.
