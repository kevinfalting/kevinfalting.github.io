This web calculator was developed in order to give new Airmen and their supervisors the ability to simply and quickly calculate important promotion dates.

I built this site using the Jekyll static site generator and the default minima theme to get it quickly spun up. The calculator is using javascript on the client side.

For building this site, I was awarded the Innovator of the Quarter Award for Q4 of 2017 by the 22d Force Support Squadron at McConnell AFB, KS.
