This website was developed to support Wichitalks. This was the first website I wrote using Jekyll. I started with the 'Creative Theme Jekyll' template and made the custom changes to reflect the business needs.

The site acts as one of the focal points for information about upcoming events. It includes several pages that display the different speakers and their videos. During the event cycle, the page transforms to be a place where people can purchase tickets, sign up for the email list, and where speakers sign up to speak.
