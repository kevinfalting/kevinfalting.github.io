            <p>Hey, I'm Kevin. Thank you for visiting the site, which I suppose means you wanted to know more about me or how to contact. I hang out at the social links below and can be pretty responsive.</p>
            <p>I run things like <a href="http://wichitalks.com/">Wichitalks</a> and enjoy solving problems with <a href="/portfolio">code</a>. Other than that, things like experimenting with audio, painting, running, and writing are hobbies that I love. I spend most of my time working for the United States Air Force where I'm close to finishing up my enlistment.</p>
            <p>I'm currently accepting requests for website work. If you would like to get in touch, you can email me at <a href="mailto:kevinfalting@gmail.com">kevinfalting@gmail.com</a> and I'll get back to you within a day or two.</p>
            <p>stay cool -kevin</p>
